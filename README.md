# Alya Forms

Have you ever needed to show something to the user and send something else to the server?
<br>
Or have a input display a certain kind of data, but work with a different object internally?
<br>
**Alya Forms helps you achieve that!**

## How does it work

The library provides you two exports:

  - The **```useForm```** hook, recommended for creating custom forms that take advantage of the library full resources. Like reacting to **```data```** changes and updating values programatically with **```update```**.

  - The **```Form```** component, recommended for simpler forms where you just need to submit the data.
